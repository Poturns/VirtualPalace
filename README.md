# VirtualPalace
VirtualPalace is a project that helps to memorize easily as playing in the virtual 3D space.<br>
This concept is based on ["Memory/Mind Palace"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci), one of techniques to memorize.<br>
This project codes are constructed on the Android and Unity platform, using Java & C# basically.<br>
And it uses Google Cardboard as a VR platform, Google Voice Recognition and a smart watch with Android wear<br>
for assisting input system.

## What is 'Memory Palace'?
<pre>
It is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information.
...In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops
on a street, or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci.
When desiring to remember a set of items the subject 'walks' through these loci in their imagination
and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any feature of that locus.
Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the
desired items. The efficacy of this technique has been well established (Ross and Lawrence 1968,
Crovitz 1969, 1971, Briggs, Hawkins and Crovitz 1970, Lea 1975), as is the minimal interference seen
with its use.
